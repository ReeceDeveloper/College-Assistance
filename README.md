# Hello ðŸ‘‹, fellow student!

If you are reading this, you have asked me a question regarding a topic about Computer Science, a specific assignment, or for general assistance (tutoring) in your course; however, read this next sentence **very** carefully. **I am no longer offering assistance**.

There are **zero** exceptions to this statement.

If you are content with that statement, please see [Resources](#Resources) for assistance; otherwise, continue reading for more information.

## The Reasoning

As of 10 November 2022, I am in my third semester of college and have answered over **70** requests for assistance from fellow students regarding a topic about Computer Science, a specific assignment, or for general assistance (tutoring).

Of those requests, many individuals suffer from a myriad of issues regarding the proper format for requesting assistance. Many of these students fail to describe the issue they are facing, in detail, provide relevant information to solve the issue, or throw an unorganized mess of files into whatever inbox of mine they wish to poison, **directing** me to "Please, please, please solve this issue! The assignment is due in 17 minutes!"

Worse, some students are disinterested in the journey of learning and problem solving. There are a select group of students who **demand** an answer without an explanation. This is known as spoonfeeding (defined [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spoon-feed)). If this is you, **change your major** or **change your attitude**. 

Lastly, the aforementioned students above usually fall into the category of "Computer Science jobs pay well, and I'm great with computers!" To see why this statement is invalid, see the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). Knowing how to operate your favorite social media apps and media consumption services is not "great with computers" when you're usuing a UI/UX that was designed by a professional to make it as easy as possible.

Overall, I cannot continue offering assistance. I feel underappreciated in regards to my time as I offered my assistance purely out of my own kindness, without charge, even for those requesting said assistance on short notice. It comes down to the fact that **my time is worth more to me, than it is to you**.

* The damn professor. Seriously, **open the syllabus, find their contact information, and use it**. Note, however, they may not respond on weekends, holidays, or their day(s) off, **they have lives**. Your lack of preparedness does not constitute an emergency on their part.
